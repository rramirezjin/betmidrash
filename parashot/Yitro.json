Indeed, reports of the miraculous events spread to even more distant places. Yitro now realizes that Moses did not return to Egypt merely to visit his family.", "<b>Yitro, father-in-law of Moses, took Tzipora, wife of Moses, after she had been sent away,</b> after Moses had sent her to her father’s house. Moses had not arranged for Tzipora’s return or even contacted her, but nevertheless Yitro felt that the time had come to bring Moses his wife.", "<b>And her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, as he,</b> Moses, <b>said: I was a stranger in a foreign land.</b> The name Gershom is composed of two Hebrew words: stranger [<i>ger</i>] and there [<i>sham</i>].", "<b>And the name of the other was Eliezer,</b> derived from the following statement of Moses: <b>For the God of my father was my assistance, and He delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.</b> The name Eliezer contains the two Hebrew words: my God [<i>Eli</i>], and my help [<i>ezri</i>]. It is possible that Eliezer was born after the death of the Pharaoh who sought to kill Moses (2:15), which is how he was certain that he had been saved from Pharaoh. In naming his sons, Moses referred to critical events in his own life, indicating that he did not consider them the unwanted progeny of a brief visit in a foreign land. Yitro thus understood that it was important to reunite Moses with his sons.", "<b>Yitro, father-in-law of Moses, came with his sons and his,</b> Moses’, <b>wife to Moses, to the wilderness where he was encamped,</b> which is the place of <b>the mountain of God.</b>", "<b>He,</b> Yitro, <b>said to Moses,</b> by means of a messenger he had sent ahead: <b>I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you, and</b> I bring <b>your wife and her two sons with her.</b>", "<b>Moses went out toward his father-in-law, and prostrated himself and kissed him.</b> Although it is unclear from the Hebrew text who prostrated himself, it was likely Moses who prostrated himself in honor of his father-in-law. Although he may have been no older than Moses, Yitro was a dignitary in his own region. Despite the fact that Moses himself had become the leader of a large nation since his marriage, he continued to act deferentially toward his father-in-law, as was his practice in the past. <b>And each</b> man <b>greeted the other, and they came into the tent</b> of Moses.", "<b>Moses related to his father-in-law everything that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on behalf of Israel.</b> Until this point, Yitro had gleaned information merely from passing travelers; now he heard firsthand how the events had actually transpired. Moses also described to him <b>all the adversity that encountered them on the way, and</b> how <b>the Lord delivered them</b> from Pharaoh and his pursuing army, as well as from other dangers along the way.", "<b>Yitro rejoiced over all the good that the Lord had done to Israel, that He had delivered it from the hand of Egypt.</b>", "<b>Yitro said: Blessed is the Lord, who delivered you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh;</b> and not just you, or a small band of individuals, but <b>who delivered the</b> entire <b>people from under the hand of Egypt.</b>", "<b>Now I know that the Lord is greater than all the gods, as</b> God saved the Israelites and punished the Egyptians <b>in,</b> through, <b>the</b> very <b>matter that they,</b> the Egyptians, <b>conspired against them.</b> Yitro considered the drowning of the Egyptians in the Red Sea as divine retribution for their decree to cast all newborn Israelite males into the Nile (1:22). Since the Egyptians drowned Israelite children in the Nile, they themselves were drowned. This was not merely an impressive miracle that brought salvation to the Israelites, but a demonstration of God’s execution of the appropriate punishment, measure for measure, for their crime.", "<b>Yitro, father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and feast offerings to God.</b> The custom of sacrificing offerings predated the giving of the Torah. <b>Aaron,</b> Moses’ brother, <b>and all the elders,</b> dignitaries <b>of Israel, came to break bread</b> in the ritual consumption of the offerings <b>with the father-in-law of Moses before God.</b>", "<b>It was the next day that Moses sat,</b> as was his custom, <b>to judge the people</b> and to administer communal affairs, <b>and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening.</b>", "<b>The father-in-law of Moses saw everything that he,</b> Moses, <b>was doing with the people.</b> Yitro saw the disarray surrounding Moses, as a huge number of people were gathered around his tent, all waiting to hear direct instructions from their leader. <b>And he said: What is it that you are doing with the people? Why are you sitting by yourself and all the people stand over you,</b> waiting for you <b>from morning until evening?</b>", "<b>Moses said to his father-in-law: Because the people come to me to seek God,</b> as I am their prophet and know God’s laws. Even if this encounter transpired before the giving of the Torah, it is still logical that they turned to him, as Moses was the most senior figure, and inquiries of judicial matters were naturally directed to him.", "<b>When they have a matter</b> that requires judgment, <b>it comes before me; and I adjudicate between one man and another,</b> including those who are not quarreling but simply seeking general advice with regard to proper conduct, <b>and I communicate the statutes of God and His laws.</b>", "<b>The father-in-law of Moses said to him: It is not a good thing that you are doing.</b>", "<b>You will wither away,</b> like a plant that lacks the requisite conditions for growth. <b>Both you and this people that is with you</b> cannot maintain the current practice, <b>as the matter is too arduous for you; you cannot do it by yourself.</b> The large nation will only become more numerous, and you will not be able to attend to every individual case. Furthermore, the people are also suffering from the lack of a formal arrangement, as they are forced to wait long hours to speak to you.", "<b>Now heed my voice, let me advise you, and may God be with you,</b> to help you execute this plan. <b>You will be</b> the representative <b>for the people before God, and you will bring the matters to God.</b> When weighty matters arise, which must be resolved, you shall present them before God.", "<b>You shall caution them of the statutes and the laws</b> that you receive from God, <b>and shall communicate to them the path in which they should walk and the actions that they should perform</b> by providing general guidelines for them to follow.", "In addition, <b>you shall identify from all the people capable men,</b> accomplished in various fields, who are courageous individuals with leadership qualities. From this group, you shall select those who are also <b>fearers of God</b> as well as <b>men of truth, haters of ill-gotten gain.</b> hese are the essential characteristics of a good judge. <b>Set</b> these judges <b>over them,</b> the people, in a hierarchy as <b>leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.</b>", "<b>They shall judge the people at all times; it shall be that every major matter,</b> which has ramifications for the entire nation, <b>they shall bring to you, and every minor matter,</b> for which they do not require your ruling, <b>they shall adjudicate themselves. It will ease the burden</b> of leadership <b>from upon you, and they will bear</b> it together <b>with you.</b>", "<b>If you do this thing, and God commands you</b> to act accordingly, as I know that you will not follow this plan without receiving confirmation from God, then <b>you will be able to endure; and also this entire people,</b> who are currently suffering from a lack of order and sufficient leaders, <b>will come to their place in peace.</b>", "<b>Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did everything that he said.</b>", "<b>Moses selected capable men from all Israel.</b> No mention is made, however, of the other qualities outlined by Yitro above. Perhaps Moses was unable to find enough leaders with all of those qualities, and those who were capable had to suffice. <b>And he set them to be heads over the people, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.</b> Moses established the hierarchy according to their merit, despite the fact that all the candidates were fundamentally qualified for the positions.", "<b>They would judge the people at all times.</b> Since there were now many judges, they could handle all small matters, and the litigants no longer had a long wait. <b>The difficult matter they would bring to Moses, and any minor matter they would adjudicate themselves.</b>", "<b>Moses sent forth his father-in-law, and he went to his land.</b> Although this occurred at a later time than the previous narrative, it is mentioned here because it concludes the account of Yitro’s visit."], ["<b>In the third month,</b> the month of Sivan, <b>from the exodus of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, on that day,</b> the first of the month, <b>they came to the wilderness of Sinai.</b>", "<b>They traveled from Refidim and came to the wilderness of Sinai and encamped in the wilderness; Israel encamped there next to the</b> same <b>mountain</b> familiar to Moses from his first revelation, when God informed him that the people would worship Him there (3:12).", "<b>Moses ascended</b> the mountain <b>to God; the Lord summoned him from the mountain, saying: So you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell to the children of Israel:</b>", "<b>You saw what I did to Egypt,</b> all the signs and the miracles, <b>and I bore you on the wings of eagles.</b> You arrived here in a wondrous fashion. Such a long journey for a large nation, including all of the families and baggage, is no simple matter. <b>And I brought you to Me,</b> to this place, where the entire people will experience a direct encounter with God, an unprecedented event in history.", "Here God summarizes the significance of the forthcoming revelation: <b>Now, if you will heed My voice, and observe My covenant,</b> then <b>you shall be distinguished,</b> a special treasure <b>for Me from among all the peoples,</b> not only the nations of the region, <b>as all the earth is Mine.</b> Until now God has revealed His love for the Israelites and has aided them in their plight. Here, for the first time, He establishes a covenant with them, which includes mutual obligations.", "<b>You shall be for Me a kingdom of priests,</b> a people who serve as priests for all humanity, <b>and a holy nation.</b> Matters that are considered reasonable by others are not necessarily normal for you. The destiny that Israel will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation is not merely a promise of a lofty status; it entails a serious commitment, as explained below. <b>These are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel.</b> If the Israelites accept this role upon themselves, they will be given detailed instructions through the Ten Precepts and all of the 613 commandments. However, before this special covenant between God and the people can take effect, they must accept the basic obligations: To listen to His commands, to observe the covenant, and to be His holy people.", "<b>Moses came and summoned the elders of the people,</b> in the presence of the entire people, <b>and he set before them all these matters that the Lord had commanded him.</b>", "<b>All the people answered together and said: Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform.</b> We accept upon ourselves the terms of the covenant with God, to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, and we will obey His commands. <b>Moses returned the statement of the people to the Lord.</b> Since Moses was sent to relay the statement of God to the people, it is proper etiquette for him to return to God, either in body or perhaps just spiritually, with their response, despite the fact that God was of course aware of what they had said.", "<b>The Lord said to Moses: Behold, I am coming</b> to reveal Myself <b>to you in a thickness of the cloud.</b> The cloud serves as a kind of physical intermediary, allowing My presence to be grasped by humans, <b>so that the people will hear while I speak with you.</b> In contrast to all other prophecies, which God conveys to the soul and mind of a single prophet, this revelation through a cloud will enable His word to be heard in public. <b>And they will believe also in you forever,</b> with a stronger faith. <b>Moses related the statement of the people to the Lord,</b> that they had agreed enthusiastically.", "<b>The Lord said to Moses: Go to the people and sanctify,</b> summon, and prepare <b>them, today and tomorrow</b> for the revelation; <b>and they shall wash their garments</b> as part of the purification process that would become the accepted one in Israel.", "<b>They shall be ready for the third day, as on the third day the Lord will descend before the eyes of all the people on Mount Sinai.</b>", "In addition, <b>you shall restrict the people all around, saying:</b> This border shall signify the location of the forbidden area. <b>Beware of ascending the mountain or</b> even <b>touching its edge,</b> as <b>anyone who touches the mountain,</b> thereby entering the sanctified area, <b>shall be</b> punished by being <b>put to death.</b>", "However, <b>no hand shall touch him,</b> that person who enters the forbidden place, <b>for</b> if others chase after him to catch him, they too will enter the demarcated area.

He sanctified the people and they washed their garments.</b>", "<b>He said to the people:</b> As part of your sanctification process, <b>be prepared in three days; do not approach a woman.</b> Refrain from sexual relations during these three days in order to focus your minds and prepare for the encounter.", "<b>It was on the third day, when it was morning, and there was thunder and lightning and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the blast of a shofar</b> was <b>extremely powerful, and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</b>", "<b>Moses took the people out of the camp toward God.</b> Despite the warning against approaching too close to the central area of the event, it was appropriate for the people to advance as close as they could within the permitted area. <b>And they stood at the foot of the mountain.</b>", "<b>Mount Sinai was all smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire.

It is evident from the verses below that even those close to Moses, who were permitted to ascend higher than the rest of the people, were not permitted to reach the spot of the encounter itself, where Moses alone ascended (see 20:18). God again warns: <b>But the priests and the people shall not advance</b> and break through <b>to ascend to the Lord, lest He burst out against them.</b>", "<b>Moses descended to the people, and said</b> God’s repeated warning <b>to them.</b> Apparently, he then ascended the mountain again."], ["<b>God spoke all these matters, saying:</b> It is unclear from the continuation of the account whether the entire people heard all the precepts directly. In any case, they certainly heard the first section from God.", "<b>I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</b> According to some commentaries, this is not a separate command, but the Speaker presenting Himself, since without the acceptance of this basic identification of God there is no meaning to the commands that follow. Others maintain that this is a command to believe in God and to know Him.", "The previous declaration leads to the demand for exclusivity: <b>You shall have no other gods before Me,</b> together with Me. There is no other god but Me.", "Furthermore, faith alone is not enough. <b>You shall not make for you an idol</b> to worship, <b>nor any</b> item that is an <b>image of that which is in the heavens above, or that which is on the earth below, or that which is in the water beneath the earth,</b> anywhere on earth. The phrase “that which is in the water beneath the earth” might also allude to large, primeval sea creatures, which were considered powerful beings that people would worship.", "<b>You shall not prostrate yourselves to them, and you shall not worship them, because I am the Lord your God, a zealous God,</b> and cannot stand another god to be worshipped together with Me. I am He <b>who reckons the iniquity of the fathers against the children, against the third generation,</b> grandchildren, <b>and against the fourth generation,</b> great-grandchildren, <b>to My enemies.</b> I recall transgressions and even punish one’s descendants to the fourth generation, in accordance with the wicked deeds of the fathers, if the descendants continue on their evil path. For a lengthy description of this principle, see Ezekiel 18 and <i>Berakhot</i> 7a. Some maintain that this principle applies only to the severe transgression of idolatry, whose worshippers are called “My enemies.”", "<b>And</b> conversely, I am also a God <b>who engages in kindness for the thousands</b> of generations, as in the verse: “Who maintains the covenant and the kindness to those who love Him and those who observe His commandments, for one thousand generations.” God’s loving-kindness extends far beyond the four generations that apply in the case of a sinner. This kindness is <b>for those who love Me and observe My commandments.</b> God’s zealousness, which demands exclusivity, entails both the negation of all competitors as well as a great love for the faithful.", "The previous precept of not worshipping other gods leads to the requirement to honor and fear God: <b>You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,</b> by swearing falsely or mentioning it for no reason. This is a severe prohibition, as the person who does so disrespects the honor of the one Ruler of the entire world. <b>As the Lord will not absolve one who takes His name in vain.</b> It is difficult to achieve atonement for the desecration of God’s name. In general, the Ten Precepts deal with the laws themselves, not the punishments for those who violate them. The desecration of the name of God is an exception in this regard, as the punishment for the violator cannot always be administered by the court or society, and it is far more serious than other sins. Not even Yom Kippur and suffering can atone for the damage to one’s very relationship with God. The Sages have said that if there is any remedy for the desecration of God’s name, it is through the opposite type of act, of increasing the sanctification of the name of God.", "The next precept is one that creates the basic framework for Jewish life: <b>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.</b> The Sabbath was already given to the Israelites (16:23–30), but here it is granted the lofty status of a uniquely holy day. One of the ways in which this precept is fulfilled is through the recitation of Kiddush, the blessing of Sanctification, on the Sabbath, in which the day is praised and its special value underscored. In the Kiddush of Friday night, one welcomes the holy day. The remembrance of the Sabbath day and its sanctification are also fulfilled through other customs and <i>halakhot</i>, such as the choice food one eats and the wearing of fine garments.", "<b>Six days you shall work and perform all your labor.</b> The six weekdays are for people to work and accomplish all their necessary tasks.", "<b>The seventh day is Sabbath for the Lord your God.</b> On this day God rested, as related at the beginning of the Torah. <b>You,</b> too, Israel, who are entering a covenant with God, <b>shall not perform any labor</b> on this day. This applies not only to <b>you</b> personally, but also to the members of your extended household: <b>And your son, and your daughter, your slave, and your maidservant, and your animal, and your stranger who is within your gates.</b> Since the Sabbath belongs to the entire nation, all are prohibited from performing labor on this day,", "<b>because in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day,</b> as the day on which the labor of creation was completed. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>He</b> set aside the Sabbath and <b>sanctified it</b> from the beginning of creation.", "<b>Honor your father and your mother.</b> Honoring one’s parents does not involve a ritual act, but is a requirement of daily life, <b>so that your days will be extended on the land that the Lord your God gives you.</b> The reward for one who honors his parents is a long life in this world. In addition, in a society where the elderly generation is respected, there will be long life, as aging parents will be confident that they can rely on the younger generation, and they will be valued as important members of the family and the wider society.", "<b>You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery.</b> This prohibition of adultery is defined by Jewish law and the traditional commentaries as pertaining to the relationship of a married woman with a man other than her husband. The commands against taking the life of another and damaging his family structure are followed by a prohibition against taking his property: <b>You shall not steal.</b> Following the absolute prohibitions that define the basic behavior required toward one’s fellow man, such as murder, adultery, and theft, the Torah presents a command that is seemingly less severe than the previous ones, but which refers to a common social situation: <b>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</b> The halakhic definition of this prohibition is the submission of untrue or invalid testimony over the course of a trial in court. Such testimony undermines the trust between people.", "<b>You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his slave, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor’s.</b> This coveting is the notorious, unshakable sin of envy, which has not disappeared in more than three thousand years since the Torah was given.", "<b>All the people were seeing the thunder, and the</b> lights that glowed like <b>flames, and the blast of the shofar, and the mountain smoking; the people saw</b> these phenomena <b>and trembled,</b> instinctively recoiling, <b>and stood at a distance.</b> They had formerly recognized the prophet as God’s spokesperson, but now, for the first time, they were granted a taste of the process of hearing and receiving a prophecy, and they felt its accompanying terror.", "Therefore, <b>they,</b> the people, <b>said to Moses: You speak with us and we will hear, and God should not speak with us, lest we die.</b>", "<b>Moses said to the people: Do not fear;</b> God will not continue to speak to you in this manner every day, <b>as it is in order to test [<i>nasot</i>] you that God has come.</b> You are being tested to see whether you can withstand the experience and accept the word of God. The term for test [<i>nes</i>] can also mean a banner, as one who passes the test is elevated like a banner, since he has survived the direct encounter with the Divine and successfully heard the voice of God. <b>And</b> He has also come <b>so that His fear will be on your faces,</b> so <b>that you will not sin.</b> One who has personally heard the voice of God and remembers the unmediated event will find it more difficult to sin.", "Ultimately, <b>the people stood at a distance,</b> as they retreated further back, <b>and Moses approached</b> closer to the place of the lightning and smoke, <b>to the fog where God was.</b> Certainly Moses was afraid as well, but his desire to come close to God and the knowledge that he was representing the entire people helped him overcome his fears.", "<b>The Lord said to Moses: So you shall say to the children of Israel: You saw that from the heavens,</b> from an abstract place, <b>I spoke with you.</b>", "Since you did not see any sort of image in your encounter with Me, <b>You shall not make with Me,</b> or for Me, any physical image or bodily form; <b>gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves.</b> It is permitted to worship God through a ritual that involves physical objects, but only if these fulfill specific conditions:", "<b>You shall make for Me an altar of earth and shall slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I mention My name,</b> every place where I choose to rest My Presence, which will lead you to mention My name, <b>I will come to you and I will bless you.</b> Alternatively, the verse can be explained as follows: When you, man, pray to Me and serve Me, I in turn will be present and mention My name. This is similar to the saying of the Sages that the Divine Presence rests upon every group of ten individuals of Israel. Indeed, this is a general declaration with regard to prayer and the mention of God’s name, which are not restricted to any particular place, just as the presence of God and His blessing are not limited to a specific place.", "<b>If you make Me an altar of stone,</b> rather than the altar of earth mentioned in the previous verse, which will be built for the Tabernacle, <b>you shall not build it of hewn stones; for you wielded your sword upon it and profaned it.</b> The traditional explanation of this verse is that the Torah prohibits such stones because it does not want any destructive iron tool to be used in the preparation of the altar, which provides atonement and brings peace. This is supported by the verse: “You shall build there an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones; you shall not wield iron upon them.”", "<b>You shall not ascend on stairs to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed upon it.</b> At that time, people wore gowns or robes of various lengths, and undergarments were not worn at all. Consequently, when one climbed stairs, parts of the body were liable to be exposed. Even if no part of the body of a priest was actually visible due to the trousers worn by the priests under their robes (28:42), the very act of climbing stairs may have appeared to be immodest."]]}], "available_versions": [{"status": "locked", "priority": "", "license": "Copyright: Steinsaltz Center", "versionNotes": "", "formatAsPoetry": "", "digitizedBySefaria": "", "method": "", "heversionSource": "", "versionUrl": "", "versionTitleInHebrew": "", "versionNotesInHebrew": "", "shortVersionTitle": "", "shortVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "extendedNotes": "", "extendedNotesHebrew": "", "purchaseInformationImage": "https://korenpub.com/cdn/shop/products/temp_Q3HL5Lw_600x.png?v=1666271336", "purchaseInformationURL": "https://korenpub.com/collections/the-steinsaltz-tanakh/products/steinsaltz-tanakh", "hasManuallyWrappedRefs": "", "language": "en", "title": "Steinsaltz on Exodus", "versionSource": "https://korenpub.com/collections/the-steinsaltz-tanakh/products/steinsaltz-tanakh", "versionTitle": "The Steinsaltz Tanakh - English", "actualLanguage": "en", "languageFamilyName": "english", "isSource": false, "isPrimary": false, "direction": "ltr"}, {"status": "locked", "priority": "", "license": "Copyright: Steinsaltz Center", "versionNotes": "", "formatAsPoetry": "", "digitizedBySefaria": "", "method": "", "heversionSource": "", "versionUrl": "", "versionTitleInHebrew": "", "versionNotesInHebrew": "", "shortVersionTitle": "", "shortVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "extendedNotes": "", "extendedNotesHebrew": "", "purchaseInformationImage": "https://korenpub.co.il/cdn/shop/products/hatanakh_hamevoar_all_new_web_1_500x.jpg?v=1591769413", "purchaseInformationURL": "https://korenpub.co.il/collections/tanakh-hamevoar/products/the-koren-steinsaltz-tanakh-hamevoar-sethardcoverlarge", "hasManuallyWrappedRefs": "", "language": "he", "title": "Steinsaltz on Exodus", "versionSource": "https://korenpub.com/collections/tanakh/products/the-koren-steinsaltz-tanakh-hamevoar-sethardcoverlarge", "versionTitle": "The Koren Steinsaltz Tanakh HaMevoar - Hebrew", "actualLanguage": "he", "languageFamilyName": "hebrew", "isSource": true, "isPrimary": true, "direction": "rtl"}], "ref": "Steinsaltz on Exodus 18:1-20:23", "heRef": "ביאור שטיינזלץ על שמות י״ח:א׳-כ׳:כ״ג", "sections": ["18", "1"], "toSections": ["20", "23"], "sectionRef": "Steinsaltz on Exodus 18-20", "heSectionRef": "ביאור שטיינזלץ על שמות י״ח-כ׳", "firstAvailableSectionRef": "Steinsaltz on Exodus 18:1-20:23", "isSpanning": true, "next": "Steinsaltz on Exodus 21", "prev": "Steinsaltz on Exodus 17", "title": "Steinsaltz on Exodus 18-20", "book": "Steinsaltz on Exodus", "heTitle": "ביאור שטיינזלץ על שמות", "primary_category": "Commentary", "type": "Commentary", "spanningRefs": ["Steinsaltz on Exodus 18:1-27", "Steinsaltz on Exodus 19", "Steinsaltz on Exodus 20:1-23"], "indexTitle": "Steinsaltz on Exodus", "categories": ["Tanakh", "Modern Commentary on Tanakh", "Steinsaltz", "Torah"], "heIndexTitle": "ביאור שטיינזלץ על שמות", "isComplex": false, "isDependant": true, "order": "", "collectiveTitle": "Steinsaltz", "heCollectiveTitle": "ביאור שטיינזלץ", "alts": [], "textDepth": 2, "sectionNames": ["Chapter", "Verse"], "addressTypes": ["Integer", "Integer"], "titleVariants": ["Steinsaltz on Exodus"], "heTitleVariants": ["ביאור שטיינזלץ על שמות"], "index_offsets_by_depth": {}, "warnings": []}
